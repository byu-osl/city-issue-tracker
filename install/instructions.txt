deactivate

Any time you want to work on the project make sure to do ". ~/virtualenvs/city-issue-tracker/bin/activate", the "." is important. If you don't do this then you'll get messages saying the module flask doesn't exist.
At some point we'll have more modules than just Flask, so we'll make a requirements.txt file that easily tells pip what to install by executing "pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt"
